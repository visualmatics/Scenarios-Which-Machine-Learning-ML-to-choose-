Visual Science Informatics, LLC</p><p>In conclusion, choosing a Machine Learning (ML) depends on multiple complex factors and challenging trade-offs. You will need to consider at least four competing architectural factors: Accuracy, Complexity, Interpretability/Explainability, and Operations.&nbsp;Selecting machine learning, which balances all decision factors, is important. Because the capital investment, in the processing pipeline stages, is costly and requires considerable time and effort. Therefore, it is highly valuable to employ a rigorous process in choosing machine learning.</p><p>Next, read my "Accuracy: The Bias-Variance Tradeoff" article at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accuracy-bias-variance-tradeoff-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accuracy-bias-variance-tradeoff-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc</a></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-choose-right-chart-your-data-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-choose-right-chart-your-data-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-choose-right-chart-your-data-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-machine-learning-models-part-1-a99d7d7414e4" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-machine-learning-models-part-1-a99d7d7414e4" target="_blank">https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-machine-learning-models-part-1-a99d7d7414e4</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html" target="_blank">https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html</a></p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-measure-interpretability-d93237b23cd3" target="_blank">[4]</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-measure-interpretability-d93237b23cd3" target="_blank">https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-measure-interpretability-d93237b23cd3</a></p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-balance-accuracy-vs-interpretability-1b3861408062" target="_blank">[5]</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-balance-accuracy-vs-interpretability-1b3861408062" target="_blank">https://towardsdatascience.com/the-balance-accuracy-vs-interpretability-1b3861408062</a></p></div> -->

The higher the complexity of the analyses (in terms of knowledge, cost, and time), the more valuable the answer output of the analytic method.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="The value of Analytics Methods.

Visual Science Informatics, LLC</p><p>In conclusion, choosing a Machine Learning (ML) depends on multiple complex factors and challenging trade-offs. You will need to consider at least four competing architectural factors: Accuracy, Complexity, Interpretability/Explainability, and Operations.&nbsp;Selecting machine learning, which balances all decision factors, is important. Because the capital investment, in the processing pipeline stages, is costly and requires considerable time and effort. Therefore, it is highly valuable to employ a rigorous process in choosing machine learning.</p><p>Next, read my "Accuracy: The Bias-Variance Tradeoff" article at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accuracy-bias-variance-tradeoff-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/accuracy-bias-variance-tradeoff-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc</a></p><p>---------------------------------------------------------</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-choose-right-chart-your-data-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-choose-right-chart-your-data-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-choose-right-chart-your-data-yair-rajwan-ms-dsc</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-machine-learning-models-part-1-a99d7d7414e4" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-machine-learning-models-part-1-a99d7d7414e4" target="_blank">https://medium.com/usf-msds/choosing-the-right-metric-for-machine-learning-models-part-1-a99d7d7414e4</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html" target="_blank">https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/06/right-metric-evaluating-machine-learning-models-2.html</a></p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-measure-interpretability-d93237b23cd3" target="_blank">[4]</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-measure-interpretability-d93237b23cd3" target="_blank">https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-measure-interpretability-d93237b23cd3</a></p><p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-balance-accuracy-vs-interpretability-1b3861408062" target="_blank">[5]</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-balance-accuracy-vs-interpretability-1b3861408062" target="_blank">https://towardsdatascience.com/the-balance-accuracy-vs-interpretability-1b3861408062</a></p></div>
